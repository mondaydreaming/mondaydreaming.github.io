          <p>Somewhere along the line however, I developed a rebellious streak and ended up double majoring in accounting and finance. After school, I translated my addiction to learning and creating to a career designing business strategies. </p>

          <p>The Web Development Immersive (Eight) at General Assembly in Sydney has cemented my passion for developing for the web - it is an incredible, living and breathing medium with the power to shape and be shaped by all who seek to participate. To me, it's pure magic. And how can you turn your back on magic once you've experienced it?</p>
